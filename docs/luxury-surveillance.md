# Luxury Surveillance
**Luxury surveillance** is a type of surveillance that "people pay for and whose tracking, monitoring, and quantification features are understood by the user as benefits they are likely to celebrate" (Gilliard & Golumbia, 2021).

## Examples
- Smart virtual assistants (Amazon Alexa, Siri, Microsoft Cortana, etc)
- Health tracking applications (step counters, sleep monitors, etc)
- Smart phones, watches, and other data-gathering devices
