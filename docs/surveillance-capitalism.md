# Surveillance Capitalism
**Surveillance capitalism** is the commodification of personal data for the explicit purpose of earning profit. The process typically involves companies leveraging their users' personal data to sell targeted advertisements.

:::note Scholarly Definition
Shoshana Zuboff defines surveillance capitalism as:
- "A new economic order that claims human experience as free raw material for hidden commercial practices of extraction, prediction, and sales;
- "A parasitic economic logic in which the production of goods and services is subordinated to a new global architecture of behavioral modification;
- "The foundational framework of a surveillance economy;
- "As significant a threat to human nature in the twenty-first century as industrial capitalism was to the natural world in the nineteenth and twentieth;
- "The origin of a new instrumentarian power that asserts dominance over society and presents startling challenges to market democracy;
- "A movement that aims to impose a new collective order based on total certainty;
- "An expropriation of critical human rights that is best understood as a coup from above: an overthrow of the people's sovereignty."
