# Educational Surveillance
**Educational surveillance** is the surveillance and monitoring of students. Educational surveillance typically assumes two forms: monitoring a student's performance and academic integrity, and monitoring a student's threat to their school and their peers. 

## Examples
- CCTV cameras in schools
- Learning managemen system (LMS) monitoring
- Aggression-detecting microphones
- Pre-installed monitoring software on school-issued devices
- Police officers in schools, metal detectors, drug tests, etc
