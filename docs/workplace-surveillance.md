# Workplace Surveillance
**Workplace surveillance** (also called **employee monitoring**) is when an organization monitors their employees. The premise for workplace surveillance is to track an employee's performance, avoid legal liability, protect trade secrets, and other similar reasons.

A 2018 survey found that 50% of large corporations are using "some type of nontraditional monitoring techniques" by "analyzing the text of emails and social-media messages, scrutinizing whoâ€™s meeting with whom, gathering biometric data and understanding how employees are utilizing their workspace" (Kropp, 2019). The survey suggests that, by 2020, 80% of large corporations will use workplace surveillance techniques.

## Examples
- Monitoring software on work-issued devices (including key loggers, mouse movement detection, etc)
- Video and audio recording of work locations
- Viewing employee's emails
- Tracking an employee's location
